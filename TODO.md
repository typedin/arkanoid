Capsule type is predetermined at specific bricks per level, but those exact positions aren't publicly documented.
Silver/gold bricks don't drop capsules.
Early/mid levels have the most capsule bricks; late levels far fewer.
Fans haven't documented a full level‑by‑capsule breakdown, so your best bet is firsthand observation or fandom collaboration.
